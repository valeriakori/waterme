# WaterMe
## Description
 Plants tend to be thirsty, but the poor programmer doesn't know how to handle them.
 Some seem to drown to easy, some seem to dry out after one week. Or was it a month?

 This Application helps handling this issues, while serves as a nice little exercise App.

## Install
This Application is a plain static HTML, JS, CSS Application without any need for installation. Just Deploy it on a common webservice and run it right a way.

## Architecture
We used a MVC like approach for keeping things clean.
